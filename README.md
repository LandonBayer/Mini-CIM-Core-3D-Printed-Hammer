# Mini-CIM-Core-3D-Printed-Hammer

Hi y'all!

This project has a really stupid start: a broken motor. I have had this motor for a little while now, and it simply doesn't work for whatever reason. I have about 3 more that work just fine, so I haven't thought too much of it. Recently, I was thinking of essential tools that I could possibly create, and a little hammer came to mind. I quickly realized that PLA isn't heavy enough on its own, and i remembered this motor I had laying around...

Put two and two together, and you get this: the **Mini CIM Hammer!** This hammer has a 3D printed handle, housing, and easily swappable working ends, all based around the core of a common FRC motor called the Mini CIM. These motors aren't really up to the tasks of modern competition, so many teams may have these lying around. If you're on a team, see if you can take an old one and make this!

After a lot of manual measuring and guessing tolerances, I had the main body down after just the second print. Luckily, the bits and handle fit well the first try!

Check it out on Onshape, or in the STEP and STL files above (separated for printing convenience, and a combined one for viewing purposes): https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c15bf52b0d1315aca788f7db/w/bd2a9d907758a01b7391a7eb/e/221615ead28ce5a95a31f329?renderMode=0&uiState=668331c9ffd07a156daee358 

### Maker's Guide

1. Print all parts, source a mini CIM and unscrew the two long bolts holding the motor together, Set aside the outer housing and back plate (with the wires), but keep the bolts and the copper core.
2. Place the core into the 3D printed main housing, and insert the screws from the back to the threaded holes in the front motor plate. Snug them down securely.
3. Insert the handle into the rounded square side in the housing. It should be a decent press-fit, but for safety, insert zip ties through the matching slots on the handle and housing to secure it in place.
4. Place on a printed working end of your choice, and get to it!

I hope you all enjoy this comical little build. See you soon!
